You are required to develop an advanced calculator program in Java that supports basic and advanced arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /, %, sqrt, pow) on two numbers. The program should include the following features:

Calculator Operations:

1. Addition (+): Adds two numbers.
   Subtraction (-): Subtracts the second number from the first.
   Multiplication (*): Multiplies two numbers.
   Division (/): Divides the first number by the second (handle division by zero gracefully).
   Modulus (%): Computes the remainder of dividing the first number by the second.
   Square Root (sqrt): Calculates the square root of a number.
   Power (pow): Raises the first number to the power of the second.
   Class Design:

2. Create an abstract class Calculator with methods calculate(double num1, double num2) and displayResult() (to be implemented by subclasses).
   Implement subclasses Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division, Modulus, SquareRoot, and Power that inherit from Calculator and override the calculate() method to perform their respective operations.
   Interface:

3. Define an interface Operation with a method performOperation(double num1, double num2).
   Exception Handling:

4. Create custom checked exceptions DivisionByZeroException and InvalidOperationException to handle division by zero scenarios and invalid operations, respectively.
   Collections:

5. Use a LinkedList to maintain a history of calculations performed by the user. Implement methods to add a calculation to the history and display the history upon user request.
   User Interaction:

Note:--
        Prompt the user to enter two numbers (support decimal inputs) and select an operation (+, -, *, /, %, sqrt, pow).
        Instantiate the appropriate subclass based on the selected operation, calculate the result, add the calculation to the history, and display the result using the displayResult() method.
        Provide an option for the user to view the calculation history.
